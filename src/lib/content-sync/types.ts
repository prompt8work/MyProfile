// The common shape every external source gets normalized into (PRD §57
// Content Aggregation Pattern: External Source -> Adapter -> Normalizer ->
// CMS Content). (source, externalId) together are the PRD §87 duplicate-
// prevention key — a sync script turns that pair into a deterministic
// Sanity document _id and calls createOrReplace, which does the job of a
// unique constraint without a separate database.

// LinkedIn is intentionally not a source here (PRD 04.2 change): the
// website is the source of truth for written content and LinkedIn is only
// a distribution channel it shares a canonical blog URL to — see
// ShareActions and Docs/development-plan/04.2-ai-lab-content-modification.md.

// PRD §55 Adapter Pattern: isolates one external API's quirks behind this

// specifics of e.g. YouTube's "snippet.thumbnails.high.url" shape.
